The current code implements a simple vulnerability scanner with several key features like open port scanning, HTTP header analysis, and vulnerability testing for SQL Injection, XSS, and insecure authentication mechanisms.

Project Overview:
Purpose:
The application allows users to perform basic security checks on a target system (IP address or website). It tests for vulnerabilities like open ports, misconfigured HTTP headers, and exploitable web vulnerabilities.

Main Features:

Port Scanning: Identifies open ports on the target system (ports 1-1024).
HTTP Header Inspection: Highlights potential misconfigurations or outdated software based on server headers.
SQL Injection Testing: Sends malicious payloads to query parameters to detect database error messages.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attempts XSS injection payloads to test for reflected vulnerabilities.
Authentication Testing: Checks for the use of default or insecure credentials in /login.
How It Works:

The program uses a Scanner object to accept user input for the target address.
Each vulnerability is checked using its corresponding method.
Results of the scan are printed to the console.
Usage Scenarios:
This tool is suitable for educational purposes and testing in controlled environments, such as:

Penetration testing in sandboxed or isolated environments.
Security learning for beginners.
Recommendations for Improvements:
Error Handling:

Enhance error handling to avoid terminating the scan if one test fails.
Add detailed logging for debugging failed connections or unexpected responses.
Customization:

Allow users to define the port range for scanning.
Provide options for selecting specific vulnerability tests.
Scalability:

Introduce multithreading for port scanning to improve efficiency.
Utilize external libraries (e.g., OWASP ZAP) for advanced HTTP analysis.
Output Enhancement:

Save scan results to a file for easier post-scan review.
Format console output for better readability (e.g., using tables or categorized sections).
Security Measures:

Warn users about the ethical and legal implications of scanning external systems without permission.
Include disclaimers about proper usage.
